# 3. Supply Chain Security

Freya enforces supply chain transparency through:

- CycloneDX SBOM generation
- Transitive dependency snapshot
- Provenance attestation
- Reproducible build verification

These controls reduce:

- Dependency confusion risk
- Tampering risk
- Undocumented third-party exposure
